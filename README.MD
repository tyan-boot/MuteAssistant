# Motivation
When i was using ThinkPad, there is a special fn key in keyboard to mute microphone and a led indicates mute state.
It's useful when you want to mute microphone temporarily but don't want to switch to voice chat program, e.g. discord.

And now i switch from ThinkPad to Surface, it lacks such a convenient key to mute microphone, so i wrote `MuteAssistant`.
